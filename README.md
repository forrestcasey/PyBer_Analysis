# PyBer_Analysis_Challenge


## Overview:
### Purpose:

Discovering how the data in the format constructed shows us the comparisons by city type, & how the differences can be used by PyBer decision-makers. 

## Results:

- Here we see that the more drivers, the lower the cost of the average ride. 
- Urban areas get more revenue regardless, since there is always a higher population density, and the distance traveled will be less on average than rural

- We can see the scaling of urban areas>suburban areas>rural areas over a 4 month period below in relation to Fare price
- This graphical data is a helpful visualization that supports the deliverable 1 analysis

## Summary: 

- Increase the fare for urban drivers in the city &/or suburban areas
- The redistribution of more drivers for ride shares in rural/suburban areas could force urban riders to pay more per fare
- Implement unique ride share subscription & rewards program that suits a particular city type, where each subscription is location-based & ride share fares are dependent on that payment program. This could help level the playing field between each city type, and even the distribution of fares for all city types based on the needs of riders for the location.
